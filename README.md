# README

In this README you will find guidance to install and run the `content-indexer-registrations` backend application.

This application is in charge of providing authentication tokens to its `content-indexer` counter part.

# Installation

You may wanna clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/sebasjimenez10/content-indexer-registrations.git`. After you've cloned the repository, proceed to install all the dependencies by running `bundle install`.

# Setup

After installing all the required gems, you may wanna run the database creation commands, like so: `rails db:create db:migrate`. This application relies on PosgreSQL so you need to have a posgres server running locally.

# Running

After having the database setup ready. We can now run the server by typing `foreman start` if you have the forman gem installed or simply execute `rails server`.


# Tests

To run the specs execute `bundle exec rspec`. This will run all the specs and generate a coverage report for you. You can open this report by typing `open coverage/index.html`.

# Security

There is a rake task to check multiple things. If you run `rails check:all` it will go ahead and run  all the specs, then `rubocop`, then `brakeman` and finally `bundler-audit`. If any of these checks fail it will raise an exception specifiying which step failed.

# Notes

There is a bundle configuration which installs all the gems in the `vendor/bundle` folder. The purpose behind this is to be able to easily find issue with external libraries, set breakpoint and even make changes to the code.
